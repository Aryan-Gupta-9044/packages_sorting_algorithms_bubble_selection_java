# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository showcases two fundamental sorting algorithms implemented in Java: **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort**. The goal of this project is to provide clear examples of how these algorithms work and to demonstrate their usage.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted sublist, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted sublist.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
